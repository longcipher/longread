## üéØ The Problem

In today's fast-paced digital world, staying informed is crucial, but challenging:

1.  **Information Overload:** Content is scattered across countless platforms (blogs, news sites, Medium, Reddit, GitHub, Twitter).
2.  **Lack of Standardization:** Many modern platforms don't offer traditional RSS feeds, making automated aggregation difficult.
3.  **Messy Data:** Raw content from the web is often cluttered with unnecessary HTML, inconsistent formatting, and character encoding issues.
4.  **Language Barriers:** Valuable information can be inaccessible if it's not in a language you understand.
5.  **Actionable Insights Gap:** Simply collecting information isn't enough. Users need synthesized summaries and analyses to make informed decisions (e.g., understanding market sentiment for investments).

## ‚ú® Our Solution

LongRead is a powerful, customizable content aggregation and analysis pipeline that transforms raw web data into clean, translated, and actionable intelligence.

### Key Features:

1.  **Universal Source Aggregation:**
    *   **Native RSS Support:** Seamlessly ingests existing RSS/Atom feeds.
    *   **Dynamic RSS Generation:** For websites without RSS (independent blogs, Medium, Reddit, GitHub, Twitter, etc.), FeedFusion AI uses **CSS selectors** to scrape content and generate a valid RSS feed on the fly.
2.  **Intelligent Data Cleansing & Formatting:**
    *   Removes redundant HTML tags (scripts, styles, ads).
    *   Corrects character encoding issues (mojibake).
    *   Standardizes text formatting for improved readability.
3.  **Automated Translation:**
    *   Integrates with **Google Translate API** to translate content from any source language to your desired target language.
4.  **AI-Powered Analysis & Summarization (via OPML tagging):**
    *   **Customizable Analysis:** Users can tag specific feeds in their OPML file to trigger AI analysis.
    *   **Example Use Case:** Mark news feeds for "investment analysis." FeedFusion AI will collect all articles from these feeds over the past day, synthesize them, and provide an investment perspective or summary.
    *   Powered by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
5.  **OPML Driven Configuration:**
    *   Easily manage your feed sources, translation preferences, and analysis flags through a standard OPML file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (High-Level Architecture)

1.  **Input:** User provides an OPML file specifying:
    *   Feed URLs (RSS or website links).
    *   CSS selectors (if not an RSS feed).
    *   Target translation language.
    *   Analysis tags (e.g., `analyze="news"`).
2.  **Fetching:**
    *   For RSS URLs: Fetch and parse the feed.
    *   For Website URLs: Use CSS selectors to scrape relevant content sections.
3.  **RSS Generation (if scraped):** Create a structured RSS feed from the scraped data.
4.  **Cleaning:** Process each item's content:
    *   Remove unwanted HTML tags.
    *   Fix encoding issues.
    *   Normalize formatting.
5.  **Translation:** If a target language is specified, translate the cleaned content using Google Translate.
6.  **AI Analysis:**
    *   For feeds tagged for analysis, collect relevant items (e.g., last 24 hours).
    *   Send the compiled content to an LLM with a specific prompt (e.g., "Summarize this news from an investment perspective, highlighting potential opportunities and risks.").
7.  **Output:**
    *   Cleaned, translated, and enriched RSS feeds.
    *   AI-generated summaries and analyses (e.g., appended to a special feed or delivered as a daily digest).
    *   Markdown format, easy to read and rendered in multi apps.
